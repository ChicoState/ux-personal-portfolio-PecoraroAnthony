# The Parking Kiosk Paradigm

Throughout my life, I've seen and used many flavors of parking meters. More often than not, these meters would be physically beat up, difficult to read, and notoriously difficult to pay for - often requiring change in exhcange for parking time (which varies greatly depending on where you are in California). Here's a look at what a couple standard parking meters look like in the city of Chico:

These meters tend to be the most challenging to use as only coins are accepted to increase parking time, the screens are usually too dim or scratched to see your parking time clearly, and are **aesthetically** displeasing to the eye.

These meters are designed much better in comparison - accepting both card or coins as payment. On top of that, they offer a larger, brighter screen to better see your parking time, payment information, and more.

However, I recently came across a new type of parking meter while my dad was visiting me here in Chico. These parking 'kiosks' differentiate themselves from standard meters by offering a not only an easier experience paying for your parking but also reduce the number of units needed to provide parking payment across the city.
