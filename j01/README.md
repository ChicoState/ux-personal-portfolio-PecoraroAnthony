# The Parking Kiosk Paradigm

Throughout my life, I've seen and used many flavors of parking meters. More often than not, these meters would be physically beaten up, difficult to read, and notoriously difficult to pay for - often requiring change in exchange for parking time (which varies greatly depending on where you are in California). Here's a look at what a couple standard parking meters look like in the city of Chico:

These meters tend to be the most challenging to use as only coins are accepted to increase parking time, the screens are usually too dim or scratched to see your parking time clearly, and are **aesthetically** displeasing to the eye. In addition, these meters offer no method to adjust your parking time after a coin has been inserted into the machine. In other words, these machines are not **error-tolerant** when it comes to payment mistakes by the user.

These meters are designed much better in comparison - accepting credit cards or coins as payment. On top of that, they offer a larger, brighter screen to see your parking time and  payment information.

However, I recently came across a new type of parking meter while my dad was visiting me here in Chico. These parking 'kiosks' differentiate themselves from standard meters by offering not only an easier experience paying for your parking but also reduce the number of units needed to provide parking payment across the city. This is because the kisoks run a ticket-based system in which people parking provide their license plate number, total parking time to be purchased, and payment via card or coins to then receive their parking ticket with the aforementioned information. By using a ticketed system, only one kiosk would be needed per block of parking instead of meters in front of every possible parking space.

Unlike the standard parking meters, the kiosks provide a physical keyboard to type in your information, a well-colored digital screen, a contactless card reader, a helpline number, and an optional mobile app. When I personally used the kiosk I found that my **mental model** aligned perfectly with the **conceptual model** of the machine. As I navigated through the screens asking for my license plate info, parking time, and payment, I found the buttons needed to proceed easy to find and **satisfying** to use. After everything had been processed, I received my ticket from the dispenser on the machine and placed it in my car. Overall, the new kiosk system felt like it alleviated many of the poor usability designs present in standard parking meters by offering an **efficient** and satisfying way to pay for your parking.
