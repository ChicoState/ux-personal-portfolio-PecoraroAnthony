# UX Portfolio

My name is Anthony Pecoraro. I'm a senior computer science student here at CSU Chico. I'm interested in learning about CPU architectures and the various critical systems that allow computers to run. I enjoy playing guitar, listening to classic rock and metal, watching Formula 1, and drinking new kinds of coffee.
